With quarantined couples put to the test, many of them realised that they are capable of being committed to their relationship for life.

    what you should be.",

    'The-4' => "The 4 C's Explained",

    'Diamond-Clarity' => "What Is Diamond Clarity?",

    'Diamond-Clarity-content' => "Diamond clarity is measured by the number of imperfections, also described as inclusions.
    The imperfections can be found either inside the stone or on the surface. The clarity chart for
    GIA diamonds ranges from Flawless (FL), which means the diamond is free from any blemishes or inclusions,
    to Included (I1, I2, and I3), where the brilliance and transparency may be compromised.
    There are 11 categories in total and each describes the level in which the clarity of the
    stone is affected when looking under 10x magnification. To the naked eye, it’s hard to spot
    any difference at all, therefore the clarity chart is required to grade the true quality of the diamond.",

    'Diamond-Cut' => "What Is Diamond Cut?",

    'Diamond-Cut-content' => "The diamond cut is how we describe the shape of the diamond internally, as well as the polish and symmetry. Usually,
    when people think of the cut, they think of round, marquise or pear, for example. However, the cut is actually how we
    define how well the diamond interacts with light. The more precise the cut and craftsmanship, the better the symmetry
    and polish, and the more light that is reflected. The cut ultimately defines how the sparkle will appear in terms of:",

Each carat is then split into 100 points and presented as a decimal. This weight is a huge defining factor when it comes to price, a 1-carat diamond could be up to six times more expensive than a 0.5 carat. However, you still need to take into account the clarity and quality of the cut for example, as you may be paying for a heavier diamond, only to compromise on the sparkle factor. The dealer may decide to describe the carat as a decimal rather than the more common fraction, so we’ve provided a small chart here for you to convert carat metrics from fraction to decimal if required.",

    'Diamond-Carat-Weight-Content-text' => "<th>Carat Fraction</th><th>Decimal Equivalent</th>",

    'Diamond-Colour' => "What Is Diamond Colour?",

    'Diamond-Colour-content' => "We often think of all diamonds being transparent or white, although they can come in a range of colours including pink, blue, green and even yellow. However, if your white diamond has a yellow tint, this will reflect less true colour and will ultimately reduce the cost. The GIA colour scale grades diamonds from D at the high end (colourless), down to Z (light colour) at the lower end of the scale. So, while your white diamond might be white by definition, it may appear slightly tinted. The less body colour that they have, the greater their value will be.",

    'The-colour' => "	The colour is tested when the stone is upside down so that less light is reflected, and it's easier to judge the colour or lack of.This also means that when the diamond is set, the colour may appear whiter.",

    if you wanted to class them by popularity and quality, we’d rank them in this order:</p>
<p>1) Platinum. It's luxurious to touch and is highly durable, so go with this if you have the budget.</p>
<p>2) Yellow gold. Versatile in price and rich in colour, so go with this if your partner likes the classic gold look.</p>
<p>3) White gold. While we love it just as much as platinum, it requires a little maintenance over time as the alloys fade.</p>

However, the more they remove the ring, the more chance there is of losing it, so you might want to avoid certain settings.",

    'fiance-to-be' => "If your fiance-to-be works with their hands mostly in a manual based job, you should avoid diamond engagement rings with a defined prong setting, as there is more risk of catching it on something and losing a stone. In this case, we would recommend a ring with a bezel setting that holds the diamond in place with a rim around the perimeter of the stone.
