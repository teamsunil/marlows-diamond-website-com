          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes. Proposing with a ring is a tradition that has carried on for centuries. In ancient times, rings were exchanged as a symbol of love and prosperity. A ring only pushes the feeling of sacrifice and commitment further. If you are not sure about buying diamond engagement rings since it can be quite expensive and your partner may not like it, you can go for a temporary ring to propose. You can take your partner along with you to buy a diamond ring later on."

          "text": "Sizing is crucial when you are choosing engagement rings. You wouldn’t want to end up with a proposal where your partner keeps struggling with keeping the ring from slipping off of her finger. Furthermore, sizing can be difficult to impossible in some ring designs. For example, a solitaire with plain metal bands is easy to size up or down. But a ring with pave diamond bands will need time and effort to fix and you cannot be assured that the design will remain exactly the same."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Buying real or man-made diamond engagement rings is completely your choice. Natural diamonds are rare where man-made diamonds are created within hours. Even though there is no noticeable difference between the two and not even an expert jeweller can tell the difference with naked eyes, sustainable diamonds are a good choice if you are searching for an environment-friendly and affordable option. If you are looking for an investment then it is not the thing to spend on since lab-grown diamonds have low to no resale value."

          "text": "Absolutely. Any stone and material can be used in engagement rings. In ancient Egypt, couples exchanged copper rings too. Diamond engagement rings are only preferred because they can bear the brunt of time without harbouring any noticeable damage. This is essential since engagement rings are worn on an everyday basis and come in contact with all kinds of chemicals and surfaces which can harm them. The same cannot be said about other stones which are not as tough as diamonds."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A few things are important to remember when looking for diamond engagement rings. There are 4Cs that every diamond expert swears by. These are Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat. The cut of the stone determines the depth and facets of the stone which is responsible for the light reflections that make the diamond shine. A cut can not only enhance the beauty of a diamond but also hide the flaws in one. Color is also essential in terms of a diamond’s quality. Where colorless diamonds are rare and highly expensive, you can always go for lower grades with prices that suit you. Clarity determines the flaws in a diamond. Inclusions and imperfections are unavoidable but can be hidden cleverly with craftsmanship. Consult clarity grades before buying one. Carat weight is the weight or simply the size of the diamond which most people end up paying most attention to. It is important to consider, however, only after you consider the first 3Cs. At Marlow’s, we provide all of these details with our diamonds. After all, your diamond engagement ring should be the best just like your partner."

Engagement rings are essentially made of diamonds because diamonds can stand the test of time which reinforces the idea of a love that lasts forever. Over the years, gold and silver can fade or even disfigure but a diamond never loses its sparkle or shape just like the way love between two people doesn’t change. No wonder diamond engagement rings are the perfect symbol of the everlasting commitment that comes with getting married."

The ideal amount of money you should spend on an engagement ring is the amount you can afford. The thing to remember is that engagement rings are about the love and emotion they represent, not the price. If you go overboard and spend more than you can afford it will cost you in other ways since you will have to compromise on important things like wedding planning or holidays."
